# memetic-algorithm-framework
A memetic (and genetic) algorithm framework.

## Features
 - Simple setup
   - Default configuration optimised for general problems.
   - Default TSP optimiser
     - [TODO]
     - A reader for [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/)
   - Pseudo-Boolean Functions
 - Framework for [implementing solutions to additional problems](implementing_solutions_to_additional_problems)

## Requirements
 - [TODO]

## Implementing solutions to additional problems
 - [TODO]

## Technical information
To evaluate the performance of this algorithm on TSP, a selection of TSPLIB problems were optimised by a memetic algorithm using the default configuration, each problem was solved 10 times, each instance of the algorithm was limited to 600 seconds.

Across solutions of sizes between 100 and 1500, there's a mean of 2.85% error between the actual optimal and the algorithms optimal. For solutions that are smaller than 500, the error is 1.19%. For solutions smaller than 200, 0.52% error.
